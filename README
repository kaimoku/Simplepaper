# Simplepaper
This is a Chrome extension that will send the current page (or link) to your Instapaper list via button or contextual menu, with easy access to your unread list

## Usage
Click the extension button once to send the current page to Instapaper.
Double-click the button to open the Instapaper Unread list.

The icon will display status (Send/Done/Err) -- this is pretty self-explanatory.
